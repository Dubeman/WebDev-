I want to build a flask based app using the OpenWeather API where i type something 
like the following in my webpage :- 

User: "What is the weather like in Norway, Oslo?"
System: Returns a coversational reply to the answer using
the accurate json reply from OpenWeather API and the 
converstional reply using the OpenAI API

Give me the scaffolding for the app.
